frontend request backend
  how to requesturl: localhost:8000
  mehod: post|get|patch|delete 

  making api means
    define response for particular request

To make api 
  we have to follow two steps
  1.make router
  2.use that router to index.js(main app)

For one request we must have only one response

url = localhost:8000/a/b/c?name=nitan&age=30&isMarried=false
    url = rote?query
    route = baseURL/routeParam1/routeParam2/...
    query = name=nitan&age=30&isMarried=false

    Everything in Url are string

    How can you send data from postman or browser

        params
        query

Middleware 
    based on parameter
        normal middleware
            (req,res,next)=>{}
            to call normal middleware use next()
        error middleware 
            (err,req,res,next)=>{}
            to call error middleware use next(error)  here error is  error data

    based on location 
        route middleware
            which is define route
        application middleware
            defined in main application (defined in index.js)
    when api is hit 
        it execute middleware form application then goes to route

Error 
    can not find package mongoose    (it means do npm i mongoose)


    mongoose is not defined    ( it means import mongoose)

    cannot find module     (means add .js in import)

    cast to ObjectId failed (it means id is not valid)

expressAsyncHandler
    it is a wrapper
    it must always wraps async function
    if any error occur in async function it calls error middleware

Status Code
    success
        in general = 200
        post,patch = 201 (data is save in db)
        get, delete = 200
    failure
        in general = 400
        not found = 404
